fd todo:
--- Critical
Wire up language selector for itext display in question props + make add language button work.
Make 'save to server' button with ajax post method (post URL set by formdesigner init params)
Fix overall FD height
Decide on correct fields to display in normal props view
fix parse for secret question type (should be easy)
Wire up 'Form Settings' boxes to reflect in generated form output
Hide button in advanced

--- Somewhat critical
Data tree view/node edit abilities.

--- Less critical
 - Write hardcore test for form3 (testing out most properties have been loaded correctly, trees look correct, etc))
 - In Form.getBindList() swap out redundant list merging code for function in util (test to see if everything works as expected)
 - Tests for XML generation (all three above)
 - Do something with the top toolbar.
 - Advanced props accordion should stay state when selecting new question
