fd todo:

When loading tests/xforms/form3.xml model is built correctly but UI tree is incorrect.
Write hardcore test for form3 (testing out most properties have been loaded correctly, trees look correct, etc))

Write IText Parser

Make 'save to server' button with ajax post method (post URL set by formdesigner init params)





in Form.getBindList() swap out redundant list merging code for function in util (test to see if everything works as expected)
Tests for XML generation (all three above)
